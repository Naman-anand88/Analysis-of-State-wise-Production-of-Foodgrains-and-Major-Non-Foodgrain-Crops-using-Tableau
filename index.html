                    This project aims to analyze the amount of production of different crops in different states in
                    different year.
                    The analysis is of data from the year 2002-03 to 2021-22. This analysis will help farmers and
                    researchers in many ways.
                    This analysis also have significances such as it will help in food security and policy planning.
                    This analysis contain data for different crops such as rice, wheat, coarse cereals, pulses,
                    oilseeds, cotton (lint), sugarcane, raw jute and mesta.
                    The visualization is done using Tableau.<br>

                    The dataset consists of a total of 627 rows of data, and 11 columns. The first column is the name of
                    the
                    state to which the data belongs.
                    The next column denotes the year to which the data belongs. The next 4 columns refer to specific

                <p class="Main-sub-headings small-text">
                    Food Security: The analysis is important for ensuring food security by providing information on the
                    availability of different crops in different regions. By analyzing the historical data, policymakers
                    can identify regions that are most vulnerable to food shortages and develop policies to address
                    these issues.<br>
                    Policy Planning: The historical analysis can help to implement effective agricultural policies by
                    providing insights into production trends, yield gaps, and the performance of different regions. For
                    example, if a particular state consistently produces more rice than wheat, policymakers can develop
                    policies to encourage rice production in that state.

                    Farmers: The analysis can help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, land use, and
                    resource management. By analysing the data, farmers can identify the most suitable crops for their
                    region and optimize their production practices accordingly.<br>
                    Researchers: The analysis can help researchers identify trends and patterns in crop production,
                    analyze the impact of climate change on agriculture, and develop new technologies and practices to
                    improve crop yields and sustainability.

            <p class="SubHeading1 small-text">
                India is an important center of rice cultivation. The rice is cultivated on the largest areas in India.
                Rice is the basic food crop and being a tropical plant, it flourishes comfortably in a hot and humid
                climate. It is generally grown in areas that receive heavy annual rainfall. It is a kharif crop. It is
                also considered as master crop of coastal India. Through the visualization it can be inferred that on an
                average West Bengal grows most amount of rice in India. The reason behind this may be that growing rice
                needs an ample amount of water and a type of soil that can hold an adequate amount of water. This type
                of soil can be seen in West Bengal. Also, on an average least amount of rice is grown by Sikkim. This
                may be due to the reason that Sikkim is not much larger in area, also due to the presence of mountain
                regions and cold climate.

            <p class="SubHeading1 small-text">
                Wheat is the second most important cereal crop in India and plays a vital role in food and nutritional
                security of the country. Wheat cultivation requires cool climate and medium rainfall. It is a rabi crop,
                which means it is generally grown in rabi season. Through the visualization it can be inferred that on
                an average Uttar Pradesh grown most amount of rice, followed by Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya
                Pradesh and so on. The reason can be the suitable climate of the state, soil needed for growing wheat
                can be found in Uttar Pradesh, also the amount of wheat consumption in the state is high. Seeing the
                data of states that grows wheat, on an average the least amount of rice is grown in the north-eastern
                states, the reason can be the extreme climate of those states, the less demand of wheat in the state,
                while states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerela, Goa, Mizoram does not grow wheat.

                Coarse cereals are traditionally grown in resource poor agro-climatic regions (agro-climatic zone is a
                land unit in terms of major climates suitable for a certain range of crops and cultivars). Sorghum,
                pearl millet, maize, barley, finger millet and several small millets such as kodo millet, little millet,
                foxtail millet, proso millet and barnyard millet together called coarse cereals. On an average largest
                amount of coarse cereals is grown in the state of Rajasthan. Coarse cereals have characteristics such as
                drought tolerance, photo-insensitivity, and resilience to climate change etc. Rajasthan is one of the
                states which is much vulnerable to climate change, Rajasthan is also low rainfall area, so these crops
                are used as a contingent crop. On an average, Coarse cereals is less grown in Kerela and Goa.

                Pulses are annual leguminous crops yielding between one and 12 grains or seeds of variable size, shape,
                and color within a pod, used for both food and feed. India is the largest producer of pulses in the
                world. Pulses are grown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons, Rabi pulses contribute more than 60 per cent of
                the total production. From the visualization, it can be seen that, on an average Madhya Pradesh grows
                most amount of pulses due to its suitable climate. Kerala is one of the states that produces least
                amount of pulses.

                India is the 4th largest oilseeds producer in the world. The country produces groundnut, soybean,
                sunflower, sesamum, niger seed, mustard and safflower oilseeds. Oilseeds are classified as both Kharif
                and Rabi depending on the season. From the visualization it is clear that just like pulses oilseeds are
                also grown more in Madhya Pradesh. It is also grown at a good level in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra
                Pradesh etc. Mizoram and Kerala are among the states which grows less amount of oilseeds.

                Cotton crops are soft, fluffy stable fiber that is used extensively in the textile industry. Cotton is
                one of the most important cash crops in India. There are four cultivated species of cotton viz.
                Gossypium arboretum, G.herbaceum, G.hirsutum and G.barbadense. Perhaps, India is the only country in the
                world where all the four cultivated species are grown on a commercial scale. Cotton is grown in tropical
                and subtropical conditions, a minimum temperature of 15°C is required for better germination at field
                conditions. Cotton is a kharif crop in major parts of the country. From the visualization Gujarat is the
                leading producer of cotton in India, it is also clear from the fact that how Gujarat is leading in
                textile market. North eastern states are among the states which grows least amount of cotton. States
                such as Bihar, Jharkhand do not grow cotton.

                Sugarcane is a tropical and perennial grass which attains a length of 10 to 20 feet. A single plant of
                sugarcane has many stems in a tuft. In India, sugarcane is grown as a Kharif crop. It needs a hot and
                humid climate, 75-150cm rainfall is favorable for sugar cane cultivation. Sugarcane can grow in any soil
                which can retain moisture. Sugarcane is produced in both tropical and subtropical regions in India. From
                the visualization it can be seen that Uttar Pradesh is the largest producer of sugarcane in India
                followed by Maharashtra, Karnataka. Main reason for such production of sugarcane in Uttar Pradesh can be
                the perennial water supply provided by the river Ganga. Meghalaya and Jammu-Kashmir produces the least
                amount of sugarcane. States such as Sikkim do not grow sugar-cane.

                areas with well distributed rainfall of 2,500 mm spread over vegetative growth period of the crop with
                no cloudiness. Location with a mean rainfall of less than 1,000 mm, incessant rainfall and water logging
